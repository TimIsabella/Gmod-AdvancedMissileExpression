### Advanced Lead-Collision Missile Guidance Expression

Targeting in its basic form can be considered a straight line from a
starting point to its target -- this is known as 'line of sight'.
When it comes to moving targets, it is required to lead that target so as
to intercept it at a point in space where it will be -- this is known as
'lead-collision'.

By utilizing live target vector and velocity data, a point in space leading a 
target in a straight line can be calculated in real-time, effectively cutting 
all corners where possible. By also calculating the inertia of the projectile,
interception accuracy and reaction time are greatly enhanced while also
eliminating target orbit.
